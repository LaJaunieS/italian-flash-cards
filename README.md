# french-flash-cards
A flash card app from English-French organized by section


A great way to help learn any languageâ€™s vocabulary/conjugations, etc. is by using flash cards, 
but no one wants to have stacks of paper index cards all over the place. A lot of the free flash-card sites were overloaded with 
unnecessary javascript and distracting ads, and were also not responsive, so I wanted something cleaner and more efficient. 
I also wanted to be able to add additional sections modularly as I continued learning. The goal was to imitate the front/back UI 
of paper flash cards, with minimal Javascript, and a minimal, readable design (just like a white index card). 

I'll be adding additional sections as I go. There's no guarantee that all the translations/spelling are 100% correct. Some of the translations
may also be a matter of opinion, or specific to the subject.

4/5/2017- Just adedd an "index" feature where a user can view all the vocab words and any definitions (conjugations, plural/gender forms, etc.) in a list format organized by section. 

Angular 1.5.7 is controlling the UI-elements. CSS was compiled using Sass.
